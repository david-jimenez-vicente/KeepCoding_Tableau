# KeepCoding_Tableau
Repository for the Tableau &amp; Data Visualization topic project.
Made using one of the internet's numerous Airbnb datasets.
I chosed a fictional international cleaning company called "Swishhh" that is looking to expand into
Madrid.
The project evolves using 5 custom-made KPIs to find business opportunities, thought to be used by
the new Mediterranean Market Leader.
Please, go to the last tab: "Historia 1" and activate the presentation mode.
